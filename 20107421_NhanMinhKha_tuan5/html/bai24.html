                <h2>This weekend's special bruch</h2><br>
                <p>
                    This weekend, our season of special bruches continues with scrambled egg on an Enghlish muffin.
                    Not for the faint-hearted, the secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a time.
